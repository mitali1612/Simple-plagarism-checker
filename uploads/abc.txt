Plagiarism is the representation of another author's language, thoughts, ideas, or expressions as one's own 
original work.

Plagiarism is considered academic dishonesty and a breach of journalistic ethics. 
It is subject to sanctions such as penalties, suspension, expulsion from school or work, substantial fines 
and even incarceration.Recently, cases of "extreme plagiarism" have been identified in academia.
The modern concept of plagiarism as immoral and originality as an ideal emerged in Europe in the 18th century, 
particularly with the Romantic movement.

Plagiarism is not in itself a crime, but like counterfeiting fraud can be punished in a court 
for prejudices caused by copyright infringement,[12][13] violation of moral rights,or torts.
In academia and industry, it is a serious ethical offense.[15][16] Plagiarism and copyright infringement
overlap to a considerable extent, but they are not equivalent concepts,[17] and many types of plagiarism 
do not constitute copyright infringement, which is defined by copyright law and may be adjudicated by courts.
