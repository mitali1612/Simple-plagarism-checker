Plagiarism is not in itself a crime, but like counterfeiting fraud can be punished in a court
for prejudices caused by copyright infringement,violation of moral rights,or torts. In academia and industry,
it is a serious ethical offense.Plagiarism and copyright infringement overlap to a considerable extent,
but they are not equivalent concepts,and many types of plagiarism do not constitute copyright
infringement, which is defined by copyright law and may be adjudicated by courts.


Plagiarism might not be the same in all countries. Some countries, such as India and Poland,
consider plagiarism to be a crime, and there have been cases of people being imprisoned for plagiarizing.
In other instances plagiarism might be the complete opposite of "academic dishonesty," in fact some
countries find the act of plagiarizing a professional's work flattering.
Students who move to the United States from countries where plagiarism is not frowned upon often find the 
transition difficult.
